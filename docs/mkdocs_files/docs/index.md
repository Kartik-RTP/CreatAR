# Introduction

CreatAR is a platform to create Augmented Reality applications in a hassle free way and without even having the knowledge to actually code the application . It enables a person to create an Augmented Reality application such that they can provide the end users personalised experience for anything they wish to create the application for.
For eg. A museum owner can create an application to enhance the information provided with artifacts present in the museum. Similarly a zoo owner can create the application to mention facts about the fauna in the zoo.

### StakeHolders

There are 3 stakeholders involved in the project :-
CreatAR ---------- Application Creator ---------- End-Users
- CreatAR - the main platform and its development team is itself a stakeholder as without it , further applications cannot be generated.
- Application creator - the person or organisation that wants to utilize the platform in order to create the application for its end-users.
- End-Users - The people who download the application created by the app creator , using the CreatAR , and use it to get enhanced entertainment or knowledge about the various things that the creator wants to showcase.
